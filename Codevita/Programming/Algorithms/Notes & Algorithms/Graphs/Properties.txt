					.Graph Theory.

Property 1: (Eularian Walk) 
	Seven Bridges of Konigsberg. (Ans = NO)
	Visit all the vertices using an edge only once.
	(Eulerian Walk)

	The vertex that is not a start or an end vertex 
	MUST have EVEN Edges.

Property 2: (Eularian Walk)
	If a graph has an Eularian walk, then the no of 
	odd degree verties is either 0 or 2.

Property 3: (Complete Graph)
	A complete graph Kn on n vertices is a simple graph
	with an edge between every pair of vertices.
	|E| = nC2

Property 4: (Biparatite Graph)
 	A graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into 2 sets
 	v1 and v2 such that every edge u-v in E has u in v1 
 	and v in v2.

 	Complete Biparatite graph represented as Kn,m 
 	where n = |v1| and m = |v2|

 	K1,n is known as STAR.

Property 5: ( r - Regular)
	A graph is r-Regular if deg(v) = r for all v in V.

	Cycles are 2-Regular.
	Paths are NOT regular.
	Complete graph Kn has (n-1) regular.

Property 6: (sum(deg))

	The sum of the degrees =  2*(E) no. of edges. (undirected)
	The sum of the degrees  = E no of edges. (directed)

Property 7: (deg(odd) is Even)
	
	In any graph, there are even number of odd degree vertices.

Property 8: 
	
	Every path is biparatite.!
	1-2-3-4   (1,3) (2,4)
	1-2-3-4-5 (1,3,5) (2,4)

	Let V1,V2 are the set of vertices from V is a biparatite graph.
	Then,
	sum(v in deg(V1)) = sum(u in deg(V2))
