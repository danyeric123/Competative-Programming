To build the notebook, you will need the software pdfLaTeX and a number of
LaTeX packages: extsizes, amsmath, multicol, geometry, listings, color.

Building is accomplished by running the command "pdflatex codebook" *twice*.
You should always run this command twice after every edit so that the table of
contents will always be correct.
